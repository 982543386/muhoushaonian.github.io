### Introduction and Installation

First class,you need to download JRE and JDK.[In fact,you just need to download JDK which contains public JRE]

If you want, you can download Eclipse or Notepad++ to help your codeing.

You can choose the code-tool as you like.

*In my building process, I met many strange questions. Some tutorials on the Internet are old*

I will show you the whole steps of my building[JDK-13.0.2 different versions emmm you know]

First,you should check the [link](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html) to download JDK

Then,you need to configure your jdk-environment.

    CLASSPATH D:\software\Java\jdk-12\lib
    JAVA_HOME D:\software\Java\jdk-12
    Path D:\software\Java\jdk-12\bin
    I suggest 'absolute path' here since the %[relative path] may cause many problems

If you finish above two steps,you can "win+R" and "java -version" to check it.
